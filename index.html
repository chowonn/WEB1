    WEB이란 무엇인가?
   </h2>
<p>
The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-existed the Web in some form by over two decades and upon whose
technologies the Web is built. English engineer and computer scientist Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web 
in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.[3][4] The browser was released 
outside CERN to other research institutions starting in January 1991.
